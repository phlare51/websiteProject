    <summary>So</summary>
    We needed to make a game, simple, not something special but
    still interesting. And yes, i know, it looks like Geometry
    Dash, but again, it souldn't be special. I made this from
    scratch, because another options like add something for parts
    of code it's not my way. Challenging part was sounds and make
    them work was not easy. This is not the finall result, a lot of thing I was wanna add but, maybe next time ;)
